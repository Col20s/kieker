Creating Your Own Event Types
=============================

Creating your own event types is fairly simple and Kieker supports
different programming languages and technology stacks. Depending 
on the used programming lanugages, the Kieker API differs. Thus,
we created a Domain-specific Language (DSL) called Instrumentation
Record Language (IRL) to abstract from technical details. In this
tutorial, we explain how to install the necessary software for 
the DSL, set it up, and create your own event types.

Installing the IRL
------------------

There are different ways to use the IRL. In this tutorial, we reference the
setup with Eclipse.

Follow the instructions to install and setup the IRL. The latter also contains
a simple example how to use Kieker IRL in a Java project.
